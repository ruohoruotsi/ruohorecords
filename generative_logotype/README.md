# Generative Logotypography



#### Logotypes & Branding

A logotype is part of the visual identity, if the not foundation, of a (music label) brand. 

Generative logotypes are envisioned as “living”, “kinetic” typographic constructions based on complex, dynamic systems capable of generating endless unique variations and manifold expressions of the typographic design of the label. 

The generative component injects <i>motion</i> into the patterns, colours and shapes of the typeface, using outlining, framing and layering to breathe it to life. In this way, generative logotypes sustain brand interest over time, revealing the personality of the label, while making it easily adaptable to changing contexts, both online and in print.
